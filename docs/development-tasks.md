# Node-Cronflow Development Tasks

A granular, step-by-step development plan using Nx monorepo for Node.js + Rust project.

## Development Philosophy

- **Micro-Tasks**: Each task is a single, focused action

- **AI-Friendly**: Tasks are small enough that an AI can understand the current state
- **Clear Context**: Each task includes the current state and what needs to be done next
- **Monorepo Structure**: Using Nx for optimal Node.js + Rust development
