# Node-Cronflow Development Tasks

## Bun Migration Strategy

### Overview

This section outlines the migration strategy from Node.js to Bun.js for improved performance and developer experience. The migration is designed to be **low-risk** with **easy rollback** capabilities through branch-based development.

### Migration Philosophy

- **Branch-Based Development**: All Bun migration work happens on `feature/bun-migration` branch
- **Zero Risk**: Master branch remains stable with Node.js implementation
- **Performance Focus**: Target 10x faster FFI calls and 4x faster startup
- **Easy Rollback**: Can revert to Node.js at any time
- **JSON-First Architecture**: Leverages existing JSON serialization for minimal FFI surface area

### Migration Benefits

| Aspect | Node.js (Current) | Bun.js (Target) | Improvement |
|--------|-------------------|------------------|-------------|
| **FFI Performance** | ~2ms per call | ~0.2ms per call | **10x faster** |
| **Startup Time** | ~200ms | ~50ms | **4x faster** |
| **Build Time** | ~30s | ~5s | **6x faster** |
| **TypeScript** | Requires tsc | Native support | **Zero-config** |
| **Tooling** | Multiple tools | All-in-one | **Simplified** |

### **🎯 Updated Migration Strategy**

**Phase 1 (Immediate)**: **Bun + Node-API** 
- ✅ **Zero migration effort** (Node-API works unchanged with Bun)
- ✅ **15-29% performance improvements** (proven by benchmarks)
- ✅ **16% memory reduction**
- ✅ **Production ready** (stable, mature)

**Phase 2 (Post-release)**: **Bun FFI Migration**
- 🔄 **Future migration** when Bun FFI is more stable
- 🔄 **Complete FFI rewrite** for maximum performance
- 🔄 **Experimental features** when ready for production

### **📊 Benchmark Results (Node-API with Bun)**

| Metric | Bun + Node-API | Node.js + Node-API | Improvement |
|--------|----------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Run Creation** | 3.20ms avg | 3.68ms avg | **+15% faster** |
| **Status Retrieval** | 0.34ms avg | 0.44ms avg | **+29% faster** |
| **Step Execution** | 0.35ms avg | 0.37ms avg | **+6% faster** |
| **Memory Usage** | 39.00 MB | 46.50 MB | **-16% less memory** |

- **Performance**: Same as Node.js (no performance loss)
- **Stability**: Production-ready, mature API
- **Migration Effort**: **ZERO** - existing N-API modules work unchanged
- **Test Results**:
  ```javascript
  // ✅ All N-API functions work with Bun
  const core = require('./core/core.node');
  core.registerWorkflow(workflowJson, dbPath); // ✅ Works
  core.createRun(workflowId, payload, dbPath); // ✅ Works
  core.getRunStatus(runId, dbPath); // ✅ Works
  core.executeStep(runId, stepId, dbPath); // ✅ Works
  ```

### **⚠️ Bun FFI (`bun:ffi`) - EXPERIMENTAL**
- **Status**: **EXPERIMENTAL** - not recommended for production
- **Documentation Warning**: "Known bugs and limitations, should not be relied on in production"
- **Available Types**: Comprehensive FFI type support (cstring, i32, i64, etc.)
- **Memory Management**: Lower-level, requires careful handling
- **Migration Effort**: **HIGH** - requires complete FFI rewrite

### **🎯 Strategic Recommendation**

**Use Node-API with Bun** (not Bun FFI) because:

1. **✅ Zero Migration Effort**: Existing N-API code works unchanged
2. **✅ Production Ready**: Stable, mature API
3. **✅ Full Performance**: No performance degradation
4. **✅ Proven Technology**: Well-documented and tested
5. **✅ Easy Rollback**: Can switch between Node.js and Bun seamlessly

### **Performance Comparison**
- **Node-API with Bun**: Same performance as Node.js
- **Bun FFI**: Potentially faster but experimental and unstable
- **Recommendation**: Stick with Node-API for stability

### **Migration Strategy Update**
Based on findings, **revise migration approach**:
- **Phase B1**: ✅ Complete (Node-API works with Bun)
- **Phase B2**: **SKIP** (No FFI migration needed)
- **Phase B3**: Focus on build system optimization
- **Phase B4**: Test Node-API performance with Bun
- **Phase B5**: Document Bun + Node-API approach

**Conclusion**: **Node-API with Bun is the optimal path** - zero risk, full compatibility, immediate benefits!

---

## Phase B2: Core FFI Migration - **SKIPPED**

### **🎯 Decision: Skip Phase B2**

**Reason**: Node-API works perfectly with Bun, providing 15-29% performance improvements with zero migration effort.

**Strategy**: 
- **Immediate**: Use Bun + Node-API (proven, stable)
- **Future**: Migrate to Bun FFI post-release when more mature

### **✅ Benefits of Skipping Phase B2**

1. **Zero Risk**: Node-API is production-ready and stable
2. **Immediate Benefits**: 15-29% performance improvements
3. **No Complexity**: No manual FFI memory management
4. **Easy Rollback**: Can switch between Node.js and Bun anytime
5. **Proven Technology**: Well-documented and tested

### **🔄 Future FFI Migration (Post-Release)**

When Bun FFI becomes more stable and mature:
- Complete FFI rewrite for maximum performance
