# node-cronflow: The Code-First Workflow Automation Engine for Node.js

node-cronflow is a powerful, lightweight, and extensible library for building, orchestrating, and running complex workflows directly in your Node.js and TypeScript applications. It's designed for developers who want the power of platforms like n8n, Zapier, or Temporal.io, but with the flexibility, version control, and expressiveness of a code-first environment.

Think of it as the operating system for your backend automationâ€”from simple cron jobs to sophisticated, event-driven AI agents.

## What is node-cronflow?

At its core, node-cronflow is a durable task runner. You define a series of steps (a "workflow") in your code, and the node-cronflow engine ensures it runs reliably. If your server restarts, a network connection blips, or an API fails, node-cronflow knows exactly where the workflow left off and can resume it automatically, preventing data loss and duplicate executions.

It bridges the gap between simple task schedulers (node-cron) and heavy, complex distributed systems, providing a "just right" solution for the vast majority of backend automation needs.

## Core Philosophy & Key Features

node-cronflow is built on a set of core principles designed for modern development:

### Code-First, Not Code-Only

Your workflows are defined in TypeScript or JavaScript, living alongside the rest of your application code. This means you get versioning with Git, robust testing, code reviews, and the full power of your favorite IDE with autocompletion and type-safety.

### Extreme Reliability and Durability

Powered by a high-performance Rust core, node-cronflow is architected for resilience. Every step and state transition is durably persisted to a local database (like SQLite), ensuring that workflows can survive process crashes and server restarts without missing a beat.

### Lightweight and Zero-Config

Despite its power, node-cronflow is designed to be incredibly lightweight. It can run efficiently on anything from a Raspberry Pi to a multi-core server with minimal setup. It requires no external services like Redis or a dedicated database to get started, making it perfect for personal projects, internal tools, and production services alike.

### Comprehensive Trigger System

A workflow is only as useful as its ability to be triggered. node-cronflow supports a wide array of triggers to start your automation:

- **Schedule**: Run jobs on complex cron schedules or simple intervals (e.g., "every 5 minutes")
- **Webhooks**: Instantly turn any workflow into a secure API endpoint to react to events from services like Stripe, GitHub, or any custom application
- **Polling**: Automatically watch services that don't have webhooks (like email inboxes or S3 buckets) and run a workflow for each new item detected
- **Message Queues**: Integrate with robust enterprise systems by listening to message brokers like RabbitMQ or AWS SQS
- **Manual**: Trigger workflows programmatically from anywhere in your application code

### An Extensible Integration Ecosystem

node-cronflow is not a walled garden. While it will ship with a rich library of built-in integrations for common services (Slack, Discord, AWS, Google Cloud, databases, etc.), its true power lies in its extensibility. A first-class API allows developers to easily create and share their own custom integrations for any private or public service, complete with custom actions and triggers.

### AI and Agentic Workflows as a First-Class Citizen

node-cronflow is the perfect platform for building the next generation of AI agents. You can seamlessly integrate LLMs (like OpenAI, Anthropic, or DeepSeek) as a step in any workflow. The framework's durable, stateful nature is ideal for managing the complex, multi-step "thought processes" of agents, allowing them to use tools, reason about data, and execute tasks reliably over long periods.

### Graph-Based Visualization and Observability

Even though workflows are defined in code, they can be difficult to visualize. node-cronflow is built with observability in mind. It can generate a graph-based representation of any workflow, allowing developers to see the flow of logic and data. During execution, this visualization can be used to monitor progress, diagnose failures, and inspect the state of any step, providing invaluable insight for debugging and maintenance.

## Who is it for?

node-cronflow is built for:

- **Backend Developers** who need to orchestrate complex business logic, data pipelines, or third-party API integrations
- **DevOps Engineers** looking for a lightweight, self-hosted, and version-controllable alternative to heavier CI/CD or infrastructure automation tools
- **Startups and Small Teams** who need the power of enterprise automation without the cost and complexity of setting up distributed systems
- **Hobbyists and AI Enthusiasts** who want a robust platform to build and run personal automations or autonomous AI agents on low-spec hardware

In essence, node-cronflow aims to be the definitive tool for anyone who has ever thought, "I wish I could just write some code to automate this, without all the boilerplate and infrastructure headaches."
