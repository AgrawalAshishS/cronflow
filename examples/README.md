### 2. Scheduled Workflow (`02-scheduled-workflow.ts`)

- **Purpose**: Time-based workflow execution
- **Features**: CRON scheduling, multi-step workflow
- **Run**: `bun run examples/run-scheduled-workflow.ts`

### 3. Robust Workflow (`03-robust-workflow.ts`)

- **Purpose**: Error handling and reliability
- **Features**: Retry logic, timeout configuration, exponential backoff
- **Run**: `bun run examples/run-robust-workflow.ts`

### 4. Complex Workflow (`04-complex-workflow.ts`)

- **Purpose**: Advanced workflow features
- **Features**: Multiple triggers, caching, validation, logging
- **Run**: `bun run examples/run-complex-workflow.ts`

### 5. Control Flow Workflow (`05-control-flow-workflow.ts`)

- **Purpose**: Advanced control flow methods
- **Features**: Conditional logic, parallel execution, race conditions, loops
- **Run**: `bun run examples/run-control-flow-workflow.ts`
